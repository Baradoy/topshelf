# Topshelf

Topshelf is a basic inventrory management system for your home bar.

It keeps a list of liquor bottles, their locations, and how much is left in them. 

## Deployment

Deloyment goals of Topshelf are to be easily deployed to fly.io or to a Raspberry Pi on your local network. 

Future reasources on deployment will come if/when I play with that more.
